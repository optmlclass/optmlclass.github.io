    <h2>EC525: Optimization for Machine Learning (Fall 2022)</h2>
    Efficient algorithms to train large models on large datasets have been critical to the recent successes 
    in machine learning and deep learning. This course will introduce students to both the theoretical principles
    behind such algorithms as well as practical implementation considerations. 
    Topics include convergence properties of first-order optimization techniques such as 
    stochastic gradient descent, adaptive learning rate schemes, and momentum. 
    Particular focus will be given to the stochastic optimization problems with non-convex loss surfaces 
    typically present in modern deep learning problems.
